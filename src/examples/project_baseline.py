"""
This Python file provides some useful code for reading the training file
"clean_dataset.csv". You may adapt this code as you see fit. However,
keep in mind that the code provided does only basic feature transformations
to build a rudimentary kNN model in sklearn. Not all features are considered
in this code, and you should consider those features! Use this code
where appropriate, but don't stop here!
